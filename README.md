## Getting Started

Follow these instructions to get the LeYu Frontend project running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following software installed on your system:

- **[Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) 20 or higher** - JavaScript runtime environment
  ```bash
  # Check your Node.js version
  node --version
  ```

- **[pnpm](https://pnpm.io/)** - Package manager (recommended over npm/yarn)
  ```bash
  # Install pnpm globally if you haven't already
  npm install -g pnpm
  
  # Check your pnpm version
  pnpm --version
  ```

- **[Git](https://git-scm.com/)** - Version control system
  ```bash
  # Check your Git version
  git --version
  ```

### Installation

Follow these step-by-step instructions to set up the project locally:

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd leyu-frontend
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   # Install all project dependencies using pnpm
   pnpm install
   ```

3. **Set up environment variables**
   
   Create a `.env` file in the root directory and configure the following environment variables:
   
   ```bash
   # Copy the example environment file (if available)
   cp .env.example .env
   ```
   
   Or create a new `.env` file with the following variables:
   
   ```env
   # Base API URLs
   NEXT_PUBLIC_API_BASE_URL=http://localhost:3003/api
   NEXT_PUBLIC_BASE_URL=http://localhost:3000
   
   # NextAuth Configuration
   NEXTAUTH_SECRET=your-strong-secret-here
   NEXTAUTH_URL=http://localhost:3000
   ```

4. **Start the development server**
   ```bash
   pnpm dev
   ```

5. **Open your browser**
   
   Navigate to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to see the application running.

### Environment Configuration

The application requires several environment variables to function properly. Create a `.env` file in the root directory with the following configuration:

#### Example .env File Structure

```env
# Base API URLs
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_BASE_URL=http://localhost:3003/api
NEXT_PUBLIC_BASE_URL=http://localhost:3000

# NextAuth Configuration
NEXTAUTH_SECRET=your-strong-secret-here
NEXTAUTH_URL=http://localhost:3000
```

#### Environment Variables Explained

| Variable | Description | Required | Purpose |
|----------|-------------|----------|---------|
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_BASE_URL` | Base URL for the backend API server | Yes | Defines where the frontend will make API calls to communicate with the backend services |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_BASE_URL` | Base URL for the frontend application | Yes | Used for generating absolute URLs, redirects, and canonical links |
| `NEXTAUTH_SECRET` | Secret key for NextAuth.js session encryption | Yes | Encrypts JWT tokens and session data for secure authentication |
| `NEXTAUTH_URL` | Canonical URL of your site for NextAuth.js | Yes | Required by NextAuth.js for OAuth callbacks and session management |

#### Environment Files Explained

The project uses two different environment files for different deployment scenarios:

**`.env` (Development/Local)**
- Used for local development and testing
- Contains localhost URLs and development-specific configurations
- Should not be committed to version control (already in .gitignore)
- Example values point to local development servers

**`.env.production` (Production)**
- Used for production deployments
- Contains production server URLs and optimized configurations
- Should contain actual production domain names and secure secrets
- May be committed to version control if it doesn't contain sensitive data, or managed through deployment pipelines

**Key Differences:**
- **URLs**: Development uses `localhost` addresses, production uses actual domain names
- **Security**: Production requires stronger secrets and HTTPS URLs
- **Performance**: Production may include additional optimization flags
- **Deployment**: Production file is used by build systems and deployment tools

#### Important Security Notes

- Variables prefixed with `NEXT_PUBLIC_` are exposed to the browser and should never contain sensitive information
- `NEXTAUTH_SECRET` should be a strong, randomly generated string (minimum 32 characters) in production
- Never commit sensitive environment variables to version control
- Use environment variable management tools or deployment platform secrets for production
- Ensure production URLs use HTTPS for security

## Development

This section covers the essential development workflow commands and processes for working with the LeYu Frontend project. These commands will help you run the application locally, build for production, and maintain code quality.

### Running Development Server

To start the development server with hot reload and development optimizations:

```bash
pnpm dev
```

**What this does:**
- Starts the Next.js development server on `http://localhost:3000`
- Enables hot module replacement (HMR) for instant updates when you save files
- Provides detailed error messages and debugging information
- Automatically compiles TypeScript and processes CSS
- Enables React development tools and debugging features

**Development Features:**
- **Hot Reload**: Changes to your code are instantly reflected in the browser
- **Error Overlay**: Detailed error messages displayed directly in the browser
- **Fast Refresh**: Preserves component state during code updates
- **Source Maps**: Debug with original source code in browser dev tools
- **TypeScript Checking**: Real-time type checking and error reporting

The development server will continue running until you stop it with `Ctrl+C` (or `Cmd+C` on macOS).

### Building for Production

To create an optimized production build:

```bash
pnpm build
```

**What this does:**
- Compiles and optimizes all TypeScript code to JavaScript
- Bundles and minifies CSS and JavaScript files
- Optimizes images and static assets
- Generates static HTML pages where possible (Static Site Generation)
- Creates a `.next` directory with the production-ready application
- Performs tree-shaking to remove unused code
- Applies code splitting for optimal loading performance

**Build Output:**
- **Static Assets**: Optimized images, fonts, and other static files
- **JavaScript Bundles**: Minified and compressed JS files with cache-friendly names
- **CSS Files**: Optimized and minified stylesheets
- **HTML Pages**: Pre-rendered pages for improved performance
- **Build Manifest**: Information about the build for deployment tools

**Build Verification:**
The build process will fail if there are:
- TypeScript compilation errors
- ESLint errors (if configured to fail on errors)
- Missing environment variables required for build
- Import/export issues or circular dependencies

### Running Production Build

To run the production build locally for testing:

```bash
pnpm start
```

**Prerequisites:**
- You must run `pnpm build` first to create the production build
- All required environment variables must be configured

**What this does:**
- Starts a production server serving the optimized build
- Runs on `http://localhost:3000` by default
- Uses the same performance optimizations as production deployment
- Serves pre-rendered pages and optimized assets
- Enables production-level caching and compression

**Use Cases:**
- **Pre-deployment Testing**: Verify the production build works correctly
- **Performance Testing**: Test with production optimizations enabled
- **Integration Testing**: Test with production-like environment
- **Debugging**: Debug issues that only occur in production builds

**Important Notes:**
- This serves the static build created by `pnpm build`
- Changes to source code won't be reflected until you rebuild
- Environment variables from `.env.production` (if present) will be used
- The server runs in production mode with all optimizations enabled

### Linting

To run code quality checks and enforce coding standards:

```bash
pnpm lint
```

**What this does:**
- Runs ESLint to check JavaScript and TypeScript code quality
- Identifies potential bugs, code smells, and style violations
- Enforces consistent coding patterns across the project
- Checks for accessibility issues in React components
- Validates import/export statements and dependencies

**Linting Rules:**
The project uses a comprehensive ESLint configuration that includes:
- **Next.js Rules**: Next.js-specific best practices and optimizations
- **React Rules**: React hooks rules and component best practices
- **TypeScript Rules**: Type safety and TypeScript-specific patterns
- **Accessibility Rules**: WCAG compliance and accessibility standards
- **Import Rules**: Proper import/export organization and validation

**Common Issues Detected:**
- Unused variables and imports
- Missing dependencies in React hooks
- Accessibility violations (missing alt text, improper ARIA usage)
- TypeScript type errors and inconsistencies
- Code formatting inconsistencies
- Potential security vulnerabilities

**Fixing Lint Issues:**
```bash
# Some issues can be automatically fixed
pnpm lint --fix

# For issues that require manual intervention, the linter will provide:
# - File location and line number
# - Description of the issue
# - Suggested fix (when available)
# - Link to documentation explaining the rule
```

**Integration with Development:**
- Linting is automatically run during the build process
- Consider setting up pre-commit hooks to run linting before commits
- Many editors can be configured to show lint errors in real-time
- The development server may show lint warnings in the console

## Project Structure

The LeYu Frontend project follows a well-organized directory structure that leverages Next.js 15's App Router architecture with route groups for clean separation of concerns. This structure promotes maintainability, scalability, and clear separation between different application areas.

### Next.js App Router Architecture

The project leverages Next.js 15's App Router with route groups (indicated by parentheses) to organize routes logically without affecting the URL structure:

#### Route Groups Explained

**`(auth)` - Authentication Routes**
- **Purpose**: Handles user authentication flows
- **URL Pattern**: `/login`, `/register`, `/forgot-password`
- **Features**: Login forms, password reset, OAuth integration
- **Access**: Public routes, redirects authenticated users

**`(dashboard)` - Role-Based Dashboard Routes**
- **Purpose**: Main application interface with role-specific functionality
- **URL Pattern**: `/superadmin/*`, `/projectmanager/*`, `/facilitator/*`, `/reviewer/*`
- **Features**: Role-specific dashboards, navigation, and feature access
- **Access**: Protected routes requiring authentication and role verification

**`(public)` - Public Pages**
- **Purpose**: Publicly accessible pages and forms
- **URL Pattern**: `/linkForm/*`, `/about`, `/contact`
- **Features**: Public forms, landing pages, informational content
- **Access**: Open to all users, no authentication required

## Deployment

This section covers various deployment options for the LeYu Frontend application, from Docker-based deployments to traditional production builds. Choose the deployment method that best fits your infrastructure and requirements.

### Docker Deployment

The project includes a Dockerfile for containerized deployment, which provides a consistent environment across different deployment targets.

#### Building the Docker Image

To build a Docker image for the application:

```bash
# Build the Docker image with a specific tag
docker build -t leyu-frontend:latest .

# Build with a custom tag for versioning
docker build -t leyu-frontend:v1.0.0 .
```

**Build Process:**
- Uses Node.js 20 Alpine Linux as the base image for smaller size and security
- Installs pnpm globally for efficient package management
- Copies package files and installs dependencies
- Copies source code and builds the production application
- Exposes port 3000 for the Next.js application
- Sets the default command to start the production server

#### Running the Docker Container

To run the containerized application:

```bash
# Run with default settings
docker run -p 3000:3000 leyu-frontend:latest

# Run with custom environment variables
docker run -p 3000:3000 \
  -e NEXT_PUBLIC_API_BASE_URL=https://api.yourdomain.com/api \
  -e NEXT_PUBLIC_BASE_URL=https://yourdomain.com \
  -e NEXTAUTH_SECRET=your-production-secret \
  -e NEXTAUTH_URL=https://yourdomain.com \
  leyu-frontend:latest

# Run in detached mode with a custom name
docker run -d --name leyu-frontend-app -p 3000:3000 leyu-frontend:latest
```

**Container Configuration:**
- **Port Mapping**: Maps container port 3000 to host port 3000 (customizable)
- **Environment Variables**: Pass production environment variables at runtime
- **Detached Mode**: Use `-d` flag to run container in the background
- **Container Name**: Use `--name` to assign a memorable name to the container

#### Docker Image Management

```bash
# List Docker images
docker images

# Remove old images
docker rmi leyu-frontend:old-version

# View running containers
docker ps

# Stop a running container
docker stop leyu-frontend-app

# Remove a stopped container
docker rm leyu-frontend-app
```

### Docker Compose

For more complex deployments or when you need to coordinate multiple services, use Docker Compose with the provided configuration file.

#### Using Docker Compose

```bash
# Start the application using Docker Compose
docker-compose -f docker-compose.front.yaml up

# Start in detached mode (background)
docker-compose -f docker-compose.front.yaml up -d

# Stop the application
docker-compose -f docker-compose.front.yaml down

# Rebuild and start (useful after code changes)
docker-compose -f docker-compose.front.yaml up --build
```

#### Docker Compose Configuration

The `docker-compose.front.yaml` file includes:

```yaml
version: "3.3"
services:
  app:
    image: ${DC_FRONT_IMAGE_NAME}:${DC_FRONT_IMAGE_TAG}
    environment:
      - NEXT_PUBLIC_API_BASE_URL=http://159.223.203.142:3003/api
      - NEXT_PUBLIC_BASE_URL=http://159.223.203.142:3002
      - NEXTAUTH_SECRET=your-strong-secret-here
      - NEXTAUTH_URL=http://159.223.203.142:3002
    ports:
      - ${DC_FRONT_APP_PORT}:3000
```

**Environment Variables for Docker Compose:**
- `DC_FRONT_IMAGE_NAME`: Docker image name (e.g., `leyu-frontend`)
- `DC_FRONT_IMAGE_TAG`: Docker image tag (e.g., `latest`, `v1.0.0`)
- `DC_FRONT_APP_PORT`: Host port to map to container port 3000

**Setting Environment Variables:**
Create a `.env` file in the same directory as the Docker Compose file:

```env
DC_FRONT_IMAGE_NAME=leyu-frontend
DC_FRONT_IMAGE_TAG=latest
DC_FRONT_APP_PORT=3000
```

### Production Build

For traditional deployment without Docker, you can build and run the application directly on your server.

#### Building for Production

```bash
# Install dependencies (if not already installed)
pnpm install

# Create an optimized production build
pnpm build
```

**Build Output:**
- Creates a `.next` directory with the optimized application
- Generates static assets, JavaScript bundles, and CSS files
- Pre-renders pages where possible for improved performance
- Optimizes images and applies code splitting

**Build Requirements:**
- Node.js 20 or higher must be installed on the production server
- All required environment variables must be configured
- Sufficient disk space for build artifacts and dependencies

#### Running the Production Build

```bash
# Start the production server
pnpm start
```

**Production Server Features:**
- Serves the optimized build created by `pnpm build`
- Runs on port 3000 by default (configurable via PORT environment variable)
- Enables production optimizations including caching and compression
- Serves pre-rendered pages and static assets efficiently

**Custom Port Configuration:**
```bash
# Run on a custom port
PORT=8080 pnpm start

# Or set the PORT environment variable
export PORT=8080
pnpm start
```

### Production Environment Configuration

Proper environment configuration is crucial for production deployments. The application supports different environment files for different deployment scenarios.

#### Environment Files

**`.env.production` (Production Environment)**
Create a `.env.production` file for production-specific configuration:

```env
# Production API URLs (replace with your actual domains)
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_BASE_URL=https://api.yourdomain.com/api
NEXT_PUBLIC_BASE_URL=https://yourdomain.com

# NextAuth Configuration (production values)
NEXTAUTH_SECRET=your-very-strong-production-secret-minimum-32-characters
NEXTAUTH_URL=https://yourdomain.com
```

**Environment Variable Requirements:**

| Variable | Production Requirements | Security Notes |
|----------|------------------------|----------------|
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_BASE_URL` | Must use HTTPS in production | Exposed to browser, no sensitive data |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_BASE_URL` | Must match your domain with HTTPS | Used for redirects and canonical URLs |
| `NEXTAUTH_SECRET` | Strong random string (32+ characters) | Keep secret, never commit to version control |
| `NEXTAUTH_URL` | Must match your production domain | Required for OAuth callbacks |

#### Security Best Practices

**Environment Variable Security:**
- Never commit `.env` files containing sensitive information to version control
- Use strong, randomly generated secrets for `NEXTAUTH_SECRET`
- Ensure all URLs use HTTPS in production
- Use environment variable management tools or deployment platform secrets
- Regularly rotate secrets and API keys

**Production Checklist:**
- [ ] All environment variables are configured with production values
- [ ] `NEXTAUTH_SECRET` is a strong, unique secret (minimum 32 characters)
- [ ] All URLs use HTTPS protocol
- [ ] API endpoints are accessible from the production environment
- [ ] CORS settings are configured on the backend API
- [ ] SSL certificates are properly configured
- [ ] Firewall rules allow necessary traffic
- [ ] Monitoring and logging are configured

#### Deployment Platform Examples

**Docker-based Platforms (AWS ECS, Google Cloud Run, Azure Container Instances):**
```bash
# Build and tag for registry
docker build -t your-registry/leyu-frontend:v1.0.0 .
docker push your-registry/leyu-frontend:v1.0.0

# Deploy with platform-specific commands
# Platform will handle environment variables and scaling
```

**Traditional VPS/Server Deployment:**
```bash
# On your production server
git clone <repository-url>
cd leyu-frontend
pnpm install
pnpm build

# Set up environment variables
cp .env.production .env

# Start with process manager (PM2 example)
pm2 start "pnpm start" --name leyu-frontend
```

**Serverless Platforms (Vercel, Netlify):**
- Configure environment variables in the platform dashboard
- Connect your Git repository for automatic deployments
- Platform handles build and deployment automatically

#### Monitoring and Maintenance

**Health Checks:**
```bash
# Check if the application is running
curl http://localhost:3000/api/health

# Monitor application logs
docker logs leyu-frontend-app

# Check resource usage
docker stats leyu-frontend-app
```

**Updates and Maintenance:**
- Regularly update dependencies for security patches
- Monitor application performance and error rates
- Set up automated backups if using persistent data
- Plan for zero-downtime deployments using load balancers
- Implement proper logging and monitoring solutions

**Troubleshooting Common Issues:**
- **Port conflicts**: Ensure the chosen port is available and not blocked by firewall
- **Environment variables**: Verify all required variables are set with correct values
- **API connectivity**: Ensure the backend API is accessible from the frontend
- **Memory issues**: Monitor container/server memory usage and adjust limits if needed
- **Build failures**: Check Node.js version compatibility and dependency conflicts
